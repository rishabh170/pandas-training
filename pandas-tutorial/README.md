# Pandas Tutorial

This repository contains the material (notebooks, data) for the pandas tutorial 

## Requirements to run this tutorial

To follow this tutorial you need to have the following packages installed:

- Python version 2.6-2.7 or 3.3-3.5
- `pandas` version 0.18.0 or later: http://pandas.pydata.org/ (previous versions will work for most examples as well)
- `numpy` version 1.7 or later: http://www.numpy.org/
- `matplotlib` version 1.3 or later: http://matplotlib.org/
- `ipython` version 3.x with notebook support, or `ipython 4.x` combined with `jupyter`: http://ipython.org
- `seaborn` (this is used for some plotting, but not necessary to follow the tutorial): http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/

I recommend to use the [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html) environment manager to install all the requirements 
(you can install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) or install the (very large) Anaconda software
distribution, found at http://continuum.io/downloads).

Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment:
```
conda install pandas jupyter seaborn
```
